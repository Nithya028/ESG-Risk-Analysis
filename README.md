**ESG RISK ANALYSIS**

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance. It's a framework used by investors and companies to evaluate corporate behavior and to determine the sustainability and societal impact of their operations. ESG aids investors in evaluating companies holistically, beyond financial metrics, to gauge risks and opportunities tied to environmental, social, and governance factors. By integrating ESG criteria, investors align portfolios with values, mitigate risks, and support sustainable practices, fostering informed decisions with broader societal impact. The dataset was analyzed, and insights were derived by visualizing the data using **Power BI**.
